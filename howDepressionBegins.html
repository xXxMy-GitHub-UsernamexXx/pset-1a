                <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
                        <h3>Loneliness</h3>
                                <p id="p-group-1">One way depression begins to arise in a person is continued loneliness.  This can be purposeful and accidental.  It can be purposefully done by the depressed person by actively trying to isolate themself from the outside world; those in places of authority can also enforce such policies on others knowingly or not.  This can also happen accidentially by unknowingly pushing people away.  This leads to a neverending cycle of further isolation and stronger feelings of loneliness, leading the person to have a depressive mental state.<p>

                        <h3>Emotional Abuse</h3>
                                <p  id="p-group-1">Depression can also stem from prolonged emotional abuse.  One common form of emotional abuse is bullying, the belittling of a person by another or one's self.</p>
